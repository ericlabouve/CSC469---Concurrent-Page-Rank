Note: Github will not allow us to upload the full graph of the Cal Poly network because it exceeds the maximum size limit for a file. Our file is 150 MB and the maximum size for a file on Github is 100 MB. As a result, the above lines of code will run a smaller network called auth.gv. This file was built on the Cal Poly network using a depth of two and is just of 1 MB.
